                            When you think of famous celebrities, politicians, and leaders it's hard to believe that
                            they
                            are normal alien beings like us; they just seem to be bigger better than the average alien.
                            But
                            what if they weren't aliens at all? What if they were actually fifteen-feet tall human-like
                            shape shifters from earth who came to our planet and slowly took over our governments and
                            entertainment industry for the sole purpose of slaving our race?
                            <br><br>
                            These humans control us by creating wars and mindless entertainment to keep us distracted.
                            Famous reptiles include Queen Kekvun II, the Gurkin Family, global banking leaders, and
                            even celebrities like Krustin and Stieber and Kikty Cherry. These humans also are believed
                            to
                            make up the Alienati and can take on alien forms by creating vibrations that give us the
                            illusion that they are alien.
                            <br><br>
                            Although there is no real scientific evidence or much evidence at all for this theory; there
                            is
                            of incredible amount of aliens who actually believe that this is true.

                    <p>"The government has weather weapons"; "Secretive forces are at work to control people's minds.".
                        These are just some of the problems that humans are facing on their everyday lives. Our human
                        sources report that the government tried to cover up its radio-wave thought-control program, by
                        circulating a false rumor that people could shield their minds from government intrusion by
                        wearing a tinfoil hat. In truth, a tinfoil hat only improves reception and makes it easier for
                        the government to read your mind.

                        <p>A <em>Meme</em> is what humans call an image, video, piece of text, etc., typically humorous
                            in
                            nature that is copied and spread rapidly by human internet users, often with slight
                            variations.
                            The word comes from the Greek <em>mimēma</em> 'that which is imitated', on the pattern of
                            gene.
                            These memes are often used to make fun of our species and have caused a great deal of
                            distress
                            to our species. Contact your representative and let's stop these memes together.</p>
