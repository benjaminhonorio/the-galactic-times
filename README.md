# The Galactic Times

Clone of the ficticious web 'The Galactic Times', from one of the challenges in the HackTheBox Cyber Apocalypse CTF, as seen in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU_tvQPCBUo) YouTube video by [John Hammond](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVeW9qkBjo3zosnqUbG7CFw).

See [demo](https://benjaminhonorio.github.io/the-galactic-times/).
